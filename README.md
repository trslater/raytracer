# Ray Tracer

A simple implementation of a ray tracer.

## Purpose

This project is not intended to be a useful, production ray tracer (though it could evolve into that) but a working program used to explore ray tracing concepts.

## Status

Sphere, triangle, and parallelogram rendering with no shading working correctly.

## Planned Features

-   [ ] Ambient shading
-   [ ] Diffused shading
-   [ ] Specular shading
-   [ ] Reflections
-   [ ] AABB Trees
-   [x] Triangles
-   [x] Parallelograms
-   [x] Spheres
-   [x] Simple camera
-   [x] Simple renderer
-   [x] Anti-aliasing (probably just SSAA)
-   [x] Progress bar
